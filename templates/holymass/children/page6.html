					<p>We believe in one God, the Father almighty, <span class="highlight">(all together)</span> Creator of all things/ visible and invisible, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, the First- born of all creatures, born of the Father before all ages, and not made, true God from true God, consubstantial with his Father. Through Him the worlds were formed/ and all things were created. For the sake of us men/ and for our salvation/ He came down from heaven/ and became incarnate by the Holy Spirit, and became man and was conceived/ and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered and was crucified/ in the days of Pontius Pilate, died and was buried; and on the third day/ rose again as it is written. He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of His Father. He will come again to judge the dead and the living.  We believe in one Holy Spirit; the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, the life giving Spirit. We believe in one, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. We confess one baptism for remission of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.</p>
